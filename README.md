# PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8: Multicore data transfer

This code example applies for PSOC&trade; Control C3M/P8 MCUs. At a rate of 100 KHz, an ADC value read by Core 1 is transferred to Core 2, which operates at a frequency more than 2 MHz. 

To showcase this transfer, the received value can be used to load a DAC. This can be demonstrated in three ways:

1. **Using inter-processor communication (IPC):** Transfer data between cores via IPC mechanisms
2. **Without using IPC:** Implement data transfer between cores without relying on IPC protocols
3. **Using shared RAM:** Utilize shared memory to facilitate data exchange between Core 1 and main core

## Design and implementation


### Inter-core communication (ICC) framework

To facilitate seamless communication between the main and PPCA cores, a designated memory block (M4) is allocated for inter-core communication. Instead of manually managing fixed addresses and address translations, the linker script automates the allocation and address translation process.

**Shared memory region**

The linker script reserves a memory region, .icc_sharedmem, for all cores. To utilize this shared memory, variables can be declared using the `__SM_ATTR__` attribute, which allocates them to the .icc_sharedmem region. This approach enables variables to be accessed by multiple cores without requiring manual address management.

**Shared variables declaration**

To declare shared variables, a shared folder is included in all main core and PPCA core projects. The *sm_vars.h* and *sm_vars.c* files within this folder define the shared variables. The linker script ensures these variables have the same relative addresses across all cores, eliminating the need for direct address references.

**IPC driver**

To enable inter-processor communication, an IPC driver is implemented to establish a message pipe within the MCU. The following steps outline the IPC process:

**Notification interrupt:** PPCA Core 0 generates a notify interrupt, which triggers an interrupt routine in PPCA Core 1.
IPC Message Pipe: The interrupt routine in PPCA Core 1 receives ADC read data through the IPC message pipe.
DAC Programming: The received data is then programmed to the DAC by PPCA Core 1, completing the interrupt routine.
This IPC framework enables efficient communication between PPCA cores, streamlining data transfer and processing within the MCU.
